<h1>Conversion_EqualHist</h1>
<h2>Using of command</h2>
Function equalizes the histogram of a grayscale image.Function normalizes the brightness and increases the contrast of the image.
Equalize of histogram use following algorithm:
<ol>
<li> Calculate the histogram H of source image. </li>
<li> Normalize the histogram so that the sum of histogram bins is 255.</li>
<li> Compute the integral of the histogram </li>
<li> Transform the image using computes integral as a look-up table to the destination image</li>
</ol>

<h2>Commands parameters</h2>
Command has 2 parameters:
<ol>
<li>Source picture: You need select source picture. You can select Picture_0 to Picture_19.</li>
<li>Destination picture: You need select destination picture. Source and destination picture can be same. You can select Picture_0 to Picture_19. </li>

</ol>

<h2>Error codes</h2>

<ol>
<li>Error code -11: Bad source picture position in picture array. Source picture is not in range 0-19. Check test program file if command has correct format. </li>
<li>Error code -12: Bad destination picture position in picture array. Destination picture is not in range 0-19. Check test program file if command has correct format. </li>
<li>Error code -13: Dimension source and destination image are not same. Width of source and destination image must be same.</li>
<li>Error code -14: Source image must be single channel.</li>
<li>Error code -15: Destination image must be single channel.</li>
