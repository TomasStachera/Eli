<h1>Object program</h1>
<b>This window is displayed when user click on Edit button on Object module window. If object was created, command window is empty.
If Object program was created before and it is edit, program with commands will be display in the command  window. </b>

<h3> Object program explanation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When is object program running is run step by step from the first line to the next line</li>
  <li>Program must have at least <b> one</b> CONDITION command</li>
  <li>Between two condition must be <b>one AND or OR</b> command</li>
  <li>Program is run for all active contours</li>
  <li>Result of condition command is <b>TRUE or FALSE</b> </li>
  <li>AND or OR between condition do logical operation which result is TRUE or FALSE </li>
  <li><b>It result of all program is TRUE </li> object (according Object name) is set to calculated contour</b>.</li>
<li>MATH command can be place in any line on the program.</li>
<li>Commands in brackets are calculated  separately and result of bracket operation are add to total results according logical math</li>
<li>It can be used 10 brackets in one program</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<ul>
  <li>Line <b>Object name</b> display  object name. This line is read only, object name can not be edited on this window</li>
  <li>Line <b>Object description</b>display object description.This line is read only, object description can not be edited on this window </li>
</ul>
<h3>Insert line button</h3>
Click on this button display list of command which can be insert. Select some command and click OK<br>
New command will be insert to the line <b>next to cursor line</b>.<br>
If you click Cancel on select command window no command will be insert.
<h3>Edit line button </h3>
This button will active only on line where is command <b>CONDITION or MATH </b><br>
Click on this button display selected command window.
<h3>Copy line button </h3>
Click on this button copy block of commands to line <b>next to cursor line</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Put cursor on the line where you want to put copied block</li>
  <li>It can be copy block only before cursor line</li>
  <li>Click on Copy line button</li>
  <li>Dialog with start block line number will display</li>
  <li>Select start block line </li>
  <li>Dialog with end block line number will display</li>
  <li>Select end block line number</li>
  <li>Selected block will be copy to line next to cursor line.
</ul>
<h3>Delete line button</h3>
Click on this button delete line where is put cursor.
<ul>
  <li>Put cursor on the line which you want to delete</li>
  <li>Click on button Delete line</li>
  <li>Confirmation dialog will display</li>
  <li>If you click YES selected line will delete</li>
  <li>If you click NO nothing happens </li>
</ul>
<h3>Update-Exit button</h3>
Click on this button close Object program window and display dialog where you can select
if you want to Save changes or not.
<h3>Commands  description</h3>
<h4>Command AND</h4>
This command do logical <b> AND</b> between CONDITION  before AND command and CONDITION  after AND command.
If both condition is TRUE result of and command is TRUE , if at least one condition is FALSE result is FALSE
<h4>Command OR</h4>
This command do logical <b>OR</b> between CONDITION before OR command and CONDITION after OR command.
If at least one condition is TRUE result of OR command is TRUE, if both condition is false result of OR command is FALSE.
<h4> Command ()</h4>
This command is bracket command. It insert two lines. One is start bracket and second is end of bracket. Insert commands between those
two lines and those lines will be executing in bracket.It can be maximal 10 brackets in one program.
<h4>Command MATH</h4>
This command do mathematical operation between contours parameters or system variables or temporary variables or constant numbers
Result of this command is store to the system variable or temporary variable and it can be used during next line calculation (CONDITION command or next MATH command)<br>
<img src="pictures/object_math_cmd.png" alt="MATH command"><br><br>
<ul>
  <li>Mathematical calculation is done between Parameter 1 and Parameter 2.</li>
  <li><b>MATH operand</b> sets mathematical calculation</li>
  <li><b>Result </b> window select where result of mathematical operation is stored.</li>
  <ul><li>
      <b>System variable</b>. It will store result to system variable. It can be select Variable 0 to Variable 99.
This variable will be set in all eli program </li>

    <li>Temporary variable </b>. It can be write any string (maximal 30 characters), and this string will be used as a temporary variable.Temporary variable can be use only in object find command.</li>

</ul>
<b>Parameters options:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Contour parameter: Description of contour parameter is here:<b><a href="ContourParameter.htm">Contour parameters</a> </b>.<br>
    There are two more parameters on the end of list:
    <ul>
      <li><u>Number of inside contours</u>. Result is number of contour which are  inside of calculated contour</li>
      <li><u>Number of outside contours</u>. Result is number of contour which are outside of calculated contour</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>System variable. It can be select system variable which will be used as a parameter. It can be select Variable 0 to Variable 99. This variables can
    be set in eli program or also before start eli program </li>
  <li>Temporary variable.  It can be write any string (maximal 30 characters), and this string will be used as a temporary variable.Temporary variable can be use only in object find command. </li>
  <li>Number. Constant number can be write to the line. This constant will be used as a parameter.</li>
  </ul>
  </ul>
  <h4>Command CONDITION</h4>
  This command do logical operation between Parameter 1 and Parameter 2. Type of logical operation is select in Comparison option. Result of this comparison
  can be TRUE or FALSE<br>
  <img src="pictures/object_condition_cmd.png" alt="CONDITION  command"><br><br>
  Parameters options:
<ul>
  <li>Contour parameter: Description of contour parameter is here:<b><a href="ContourParameter.htm">Contour parameters</a> </b>.<br>
    There are two more parameters on the end of list:
    <ul>
      <li><u>Number of inside contours</u>. Result is number of contour which are  inside of calculated contour</li>
      <li><u>Number of outside contours</u>. Result is number of contour which are outside of calculated contour</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>System variable. It can be select system variable which will be used as a parameter. It can be select Variable 0 to Variable 99. This variables can
    be set in eli program or also before start eli program </li>
  <li>Temporary variable.  It can be write any string (maximal 30 characters), and this string will be used as a temporary variable.Temporary variable can be use only in object find command. </li>
  <li>Number. Constant number can be write to the line. This constant will be used as a parameter.</li>
  </ul>
  </ul>
